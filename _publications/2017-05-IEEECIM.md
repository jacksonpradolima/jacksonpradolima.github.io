Abstract
===
A Software Product Line (SPL) is defined as a set of software systems that share a common and managed set of features satisfying specific needs of a particular market segment or domain [1]. The SPL offers a number of common artifacts for building products, including mandatory and variable elements. SPL approaches have been adopted by many software companies1 to ease reuse and reduce time and production costs. A feature represents a functionality that is visible to the user and can be designed as a variability, which represents a variable functionality that may or may not be present in a product. On the other hand, mandatory features are common to all SPL products. To facilitate feature management, most SPL methodologies use the Feature Model (FM) [2] to represent all the SPL variabilities and commonalities.
