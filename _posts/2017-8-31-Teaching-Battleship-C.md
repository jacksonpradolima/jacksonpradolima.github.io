Battleship in C with options in Portuguese ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/brazil.png)

A class work for the Federal University of Paraná students, class CI067 - Oficina de Computação (CI067 - Computer Workshop).

To provide an example of solution using basic concepts (function, matrix, comments), I develop a project on GitHub with menu options and comments in portuguese. 

You can download the document about the project at [here](https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/battleship/raw/master/trabalho/Batalha%20Naval.pdf).
